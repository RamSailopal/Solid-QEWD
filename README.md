# Solid-QEWD

A proof of concepr showing the potential of YottaDB as a backend store for solid server
JSON
Since solid-server stores data in the file system as JSON files . The key/value nature of both JSON and YottaDB brings synergies this repo shows the cross compatibility potential of both approaches

A public Solid service set of containers is referenced to and then the truple representation of the containers converted to JSON-LD before being stored in YottaDB.

Public Solid service: https://rsailopal.inrupt.net

 # Gitpod Demo
 
1) Create a free/paid Gitpod account - https://www.gitpod.io/
2) Log into the account
3) Open a new browser tab and add **gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RamSailopal/Solid-QEWD/tree/noqewd** to the address - This will create a new Gitpod cloud instance and display three terminal windows. The second will be a YottaDB environment and then third a nodejs environment. Wait for a prompt to appear in the third window and then run:

    node turtparse.js https://rsailopal.inrupt.net
    
This will parse rest api data returned as turtle syntax into JSON-ld and then store the data in YottaDB. In the second window a global listing will show the entries in a global **SOLID**
